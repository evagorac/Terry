## TERRY

Here is a project I worked on during the summer of 2020.

Terry is a 6 dof spherical robot arm that is capable of visiting any position and orientation in space within the arm's reach.  This repository encapsulates the CAD modeling done while designing the robot arm.

Nested within this repo is a submodule called TBrain where I plan to implement the math / matrix transformations for an analytical ikine solution from scratch.  This is where my work will be mostly focused now that summer 2020 is coming to a close and I have nearly finished the physcial construction of Terry.

I have no plans to use Terry for commerical purposes.
